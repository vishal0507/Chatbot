Chatbot Application tools and technologies used are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and ReactJS.
Chatbot is an application where it gives the response to the user's questions, which are all given in the database. If a user asks for a date, provide a date; if a user asks for a time, provide a time; and if a user asks for a link, provide a link. We can add the data for the reply to the questions. I created the utils.js file in the Components folder. We can add more dA ata for the answer.
A chatbot is useful to add to our website because it will interact with the user when they enter our website. We can get contact details and other information from users by using the chatbot.
